# Progetto_STM32

This project is focused on developing and implementing an algorythm for human face counting in a closed space using _STM32F429_.
The algorythm chosen is **Viola-Jones**, able to detect faces using visual features like the distribution of shadows of a human head, allowing an implementation that requires low computational power.
